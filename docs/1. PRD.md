## 21. Open Questions & Decisions Needed

### Technical Decisions

1. **File Storage Strategy:** Supabase Storage vs Cloudflare R2 for large files (>100MB)?
   - **Decision:** Start with Supabase Storage, migrate to R2 if costs exceed $100/mo
2. **Email Provider:** Resend vs Brevo (SendinBlue) for Ethiopian market?
   - **Decision:** Resend for MVP, monitor deliverability closely
3. **Monitoring:** Which error tracking tool? (Sentry, LogRocket, or Datadog)
   - **Decision:** Sentry (best free tier, excellent Next.js integration)
4. **Calendar API:** Only Google Calendar, or also support Outlook/Apple Calendar?
   - **Decision:** Google Calendar only for MVP, add others in Phase 2

### Business Decisions

1. **Payment Processor Priority:** Should Chapa be MVP or Phase 2?
   - **Decision:** Phase 2 (focus on Telebirr first, add Chapa if demand exists)
2. **Manual Creator Approval:** Should ALL new creators be manually approved, or only after first flag?
   - **Decision:** Auto-approve with automated moderation, manual review only if flagged
3. **Payout Schedule:** Weekly vs Monthly payouts to creators?
   - **Decision:** Monthly (15th of each month) - easier to manage, standard in industry
4. **Customer Support:** Self-service only (help docs) or live chat from Day 1?
   - **Decision:** Self-service + email support for MVP, add live chat in Month 3

### Product Decisions

1. **Storefront URLs:** `fabrica.et/username` vs `username.fabrica.et`?
   - **Decision:** `fabrica.et/username` (simpler DNS, easier to scale)
2. **Product Limits:** Should free trial have product creation limits (e.g., max 3 products)?
   - **Decision:** No limits during trial, unlimited products on all paid plans
3. **Booking Cancellations:** Allow customers to cancel/reschedule, or creator-only?
   - **Decision:** Creator-only for MVP, add customer self-service in Phase 2
4. **Transaction Fees:** Pass 100% of payment processor fees to creators, or absorb partially?
   - **Decision:** 100% pass-through (transparent), no platform transaction fee

## 21. Open Questions & Decisions Needed

### Technical Decisions

1. **File Storage Strategy:** Supabase Storage vs Cloudflare R2 for large files (>100MB)?
2. **Email Provider:** Resend vs Brevo (SendinBlue) for Ethiopian market?
3. **Monitoring:** Which error tracking tool? (Sentry, LogRocket, or Datadog)
4. **Calendar API:** Only Google Calendar, or also support Outlook/Apple Calendar?

### Business Decisions

1. **Payment Processor Priority:** Should Chapa be MVP or Phase 2?
2. **Manual Creator Approval:** Should ALL new creators be manually approved, or only after first flag?
3. **Payout Schedule:** Weekly vs Monthly payouts to creators?
4. **Customer Support:** Self-service only (help docs) or live chat from Day 1?

### Product Decisions

1. **Storefront URLs:** `fabrica.et/username` vs `username.fabrica.et`?
2. **Product Limits:** Should free trial have product creation limits (e.g., max 3 products)?
3. **Booking Cancellations:** Allow customers to cancel/reschedule, or creator-only?
4. **Transaction Fees:** Pass 100% of payment processor fees to creators, or absorb partially?
