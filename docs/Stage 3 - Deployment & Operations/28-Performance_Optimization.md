# Performance Optimization Guide (Stan Store Windsurf Creator Platform)

## Introduction

This document outlines performance optimization strategies implemented in the Stan Store Windsurf creator platform to ensure fast store loading times, smooth creator interactions, and efficient resource usage across all creator features. These optimizations are designed for modern creator platform standards while considering Ethiopian network conditions and device capabilities for optimal creator and customer experience across our **Microservice Architecture**.

The performance optimization strategy applies to all layers of our creator platform:

- **Client-Side**: Creator Web Dashboard (Next.js) and Mobile Apps (React Native)
- **Network Layer**: API Gateway and creator service-to-service communication
- **Server-Side**: Creator microservices (NestJS) and databases (PostgreSQL/Redis)

## Key Performance Metrics

| Metric                     | Target        | Notes                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Client-Side (P95)**      |               |                                                  |
| App Cold Start             | < 2 seconds   | Measured on representative Ethiopian devices     |
| Screen Transition          | < 300 ms      | For common user flows                            |
| Web Vitals (LCP)           | < 2.5 seconds | For our merchant and admin portals               |
| **Backend (P95)**          |               |                                                  |
| API Gateway Latency        | < 200 ms      | Time for request processing at the edge          |
| Service-to-Service Latency | < 50 ms       | Internal gRPC call latency                       |
| Payment Processing (P99)   | < 3 seconds   | End-to-end, including Ethiopian provider latency |
| Database Query Time        | < 20 ms       | For indexed queries in service-specific DBs      |

## Implemented & Planned Optimizations

### 1. Client-Side Performance (Mobile & Web)

- **Code Splitting**: Features are loaded on demand, reducing the initial bundle size for both the
  React Native and Next.js apps.
- **Image Optimization**: Use of modern formats (WebP), correct sizing, and lazy loading for all
  images.
- **Minimal Renders**: Judicious use of `React.memo`, `useCallback`, and `useMemo` to prevent
  unnecessary re-renders.
- **Optimistic UI**: For non-critical operations, update the UI immediately while the network
  request runs in the background.

### 2. Backend & Microservice Performance

#### 2.1 Inter-Service Communication

- **Protocol Choice**: We use **gRPC** with **Protocol Buffers** for synchronous internal
  communication. This is significantly faster and more efficient than REST/JSON due to its binary
  serialization format.
- **Connection Pooling**: Maintained connection pools for gRPC clients to avoid the overhead of
  re-establishing connections for every request.
- **Asynchronous Communication**: For non-blocking operations, we use an event bus (e.g., Kafka) to
  decouple services and improve overall system responsiveness.

#### 2.2 Data Serialization

- The use of Protocol Buffers minimizes the size of data payloads sent between services, reducing
  network latency and CPU time spent on serialization/deserialization. This is a major advantage
  over text-based formats like JSON.

#### 2.3 Database Optimization

- **Database-per-Service**: Each microservice has its own database, preventing contention and
  allowing for technology choices best suited for the service's needs (e.g., PostgreSQL for
  transactional data, Redis for caching).
- **Indexing**: All database queries are analyzed, and appropriate indexes are created to ensure
  fast lookups. Slow query logs are monitored continuously.
- **Connection Pooling**: Each service maintains a connection pool to its database to reduce the
  latency of establishing new connections.

#### 2.4 Caching Strategy

- **Client-Side Caching**: Using tools like React Query or Apollo Client to cache server state on
  the client.
- **Edge Caching**: Using a CDN (CloudFront) to cache static assets and certain API responses.
- **Distributed Cache**: Using Redis (ElastiCache) for caching frequently accessed, non-volatile
  data that is shared across services.
- **In-Memory Cache**: Caching data within a single service instance for data with very high access
  rates.

### 3. Service Mesh & Observability

- We will implement a **Service Mesh** (like Istio or Linkerd) to gain deep visibility into the
  performance of our distributed system. A service mesh provides:
  - **Automated Metrics**: Out-of-the-box latency, error rate, and throughput metrics for all
    service-to-service communication.
  - **Distributed Tracing**: Simplified integration of distributed tracing to visualize the entire
    path of a request.
  - **Intelligent Routing**: Advanced traffic management capabilities like blue-green deployments
    and canary releases, which can be done with zero downtime.

## Performance Testing Strategy

### 1. Automated Performance Testing

- Implement automated performance tests using Detox
- Set up CI/CD pipeline to run performance tests on each release
- Track performance metrics over time

### 2. Real Device Testing

- Test on representative devices from the Ethiopian market
- Include low-end Android devices in testing matrix
- Test under varying network conditions (2G, 3G, 4G, Wi-Fi)

### 3. Performance Monitoring

- Implement real-time performance monitoring using tools like Firebase Performance Monitoring
- Set up alerts for performance regressions
- Collect anonymous performance data from production users (with consent)

## Conclusion

Performance optimization is an ongoing process that requires regular monitoring and improvements.
The implemented optimizations have laid the groundwork for better performance, but continuous
measurement and refinement are necessary to achieve and maintain optimal performance targets.
