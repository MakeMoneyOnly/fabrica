# Cloud Cost Management Strategy (Stan Store Windsurf Creator Platform)

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for monitoring, managing, and optimizing cloud infrastructure
and Ethiopian payment service costs for the Stan Store Windsurf creator platform. Effective cost management
ensures financial sustainability and efficient resource utilization across our **Creator Microservice
Architecture**, supporting our zero transaction fee business model.

The cost management strategy covers all individually deployable components:

- **Microservices**: Tracking the cost of each service (e.g., `payments-service`, `auth-service`).
- **Shared Infrastructure**: EKS control plane, networking, monitoring stack.
- **Third-Party Services**: Ethiopian Payment Providers, KYC services, etc.

## Principles

- **Cost Visibility:** Maintain clear visibility into spending patterns across all services and
  environments.
- **Cost Attribution:** Attribute costs accurately to specific microservices, environments, or
  teams. This is a primary driver of our strategy.
- **Continuous Optimization:** Regularly review and implement cost-saving measures without
  compromising performance or reliability.
- **Budget Awareness:** Set budgets and alerts to proactively manage spending.
- **Accountability:** The DevOps team lead is primarily responsible for driving the cost management
  process.

## Tools & Monitoring

- **AWS Cost Explorer:** Primary tool for analyzing AWS spending trends, filtering by service, tags
  (including `Compliance=nbe`), etc.
- **AWS Budgets:** Set custom budgets for overall spending or specific services/tags; configure
  alerts for actual or forecasted overruns.
- **AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR):** Detailed billing data stored in S3 for granular analysis.
- **Ethiopian Payment Provider Dashboards/Reports:** Monitor transaction fees and usage costs
  associated with Telebirr, HelloCash, etc.
- **(If using API) AI Service Usage Dashboard (e.g., OpenAI):** Monitor token consumption and
  associated costs.
- **Application Metrics:** Track internal metrics (e.g., API calls per feature, Telebirr transaction
  volume, KYC checks via Didit) that correlate with cloud and provider costs.
- **Grafana/Datadog:** Dashboards visualizing key cost-related metrics alongside performance
  metrics.

## Cost Allocation & Tagging Strategy

- **Mandatory Tags:** All taggable AWS resources MUST be tagged with:
  - `Environment`: (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `production`)
  - `Project`: `meqenet-ethiopia`
  - `ServiceName`: The name of the microservice the resource belongs to (e.g., `payments-service`,
    `auth-service`, or `shared-infra` for non-service-specific resources). **This is the most
    critical tag for cost attribution.**
  - `ManagedBy`: `terraform`
  - `Compliance`: (e.g., `nbe`, `general`) - To track costs associated with specific compliance
    controls.
- **Purpose:** The `ServiceName` tag enables precise filtering in AWS Cost Explorer to attribute
  infrastructure costs directly to the microservice consuming them.
- **Enforcement:** Use AWS Config rules and Terraform linters to enforce tagging policies. A CI/CD
  check will fail pull requests that contain untagged resources.

## Optimization Strategies

### Compute (EKS / EC2)

- **Rightsizing:** Regularly review instance types based on utilization metrics, considering typical
  Ethiopian traffic patterns.
- **Autoscaling:** Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Cluster Autoscaler effectively to
  match load, scaling down during off-peak hours.
- **Instance Types:** Utilize Graviton (ARM-based) instances where compatible for better
  price/performance.
- **Spot Instances:** Use Spot instances strategically for fault-tolerant workloads, especially in
  `dev` and `staging` environments.
- **Reserved Instances (RIs) / Savings Plans:** Purchase RIs or Savings Plans for stable,
  predictable production workloads to achieve significant discounts. Analyze usage patterns before
  committing.

### Storage (RDS, S3, EBS)

- **RDS Rightsizing:** Choose appropriate RDS instance sizes.
- **Storage Tiering:** Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering or Lifecycle Policies to move infrequently
  accessed data to lower-cost tiers (e.g., Standard-IA, Glacier).
- **EBS Volume Types:** Use `gp3` volumes and configure IOPS/throughput appropriately instead of
  over-provisioning `gp2` or `io1/io2`.
- **Snapshot Management:** Implement lifecycle policies aligned with NBE data retention rules.
- **Data Transfer Costs:** Monitor data transfer costs, especially egress traffic from the chosen
  AWS region. Factor in costs related to potential NBE data localization requirements. Use
  CloudFront CDN effectively for Ethiopian users. Use VPC Endpoints for private AWS service
  communication.

### Database & Cache (PostgreSQL, Redis)

- Optimize queries to reduce database load.
- Use read replicas for RDS if read-heavy.
- Implement caching effectively (ElastiCache/Redis) to reduce database hits.
- Rightsize ElastiCache nodes.

### AI Services (If using API like OpenAI)

- **Model Selection:** Use the most cost-effective model suitable for analyzing Ethiopian
  alternative data.
- **Prompt Optimization:** Design concise prompts incorporating Ethiopian context efficiently.
- **Caching:** Cache responses for identical or very similar prompts where appropriate.
- **Usage Monitoring:** Track token usage per feature or user via OpenAI dashboard and application
  logs.
- **User Quotas/Limits:** Implement limits on AI generation features per user tier if necessary.
- **Adaptation Technique Costs:** Be mindful of the cost hierarchy: **Prompt Engineering (lowest
  cost) < Prompt Tuning / PEFT < Full Fine-Tuning (highest cost)**. Choose the most cost-effective
  technique that meets performance requirements.

### Ethiopian Payment Provider Integrations

- **Fee Monitoring:** Actively monitor transaction fees charged by Telebirr, HelloCash, etc.
  Understand their fee structures.
- **API Call Optimization:** Optimize application logic to minimize unnecessary API calls to payment
  providers.
- **Provider Choice (if applicable):** If multiple providers are viable for certain operations,
  consider relative costs (requires business analysis).

### KYC Services (e.g., Didit)

- **Usage Monitoring:** Track the number of KYC checks performed.
- **Cost Structure:** Understand the pricing model (per check, tiered, etc.).
- **Optimization:** Avoid redundant checks; potentially use caching for recent verification results
  if compliant.

## Budgeting and Alerts

- Set monthly budgets in AWS Budgets for overall account spending and key services.
- Estimate and track budgets for key third-party services (Ethiopian Payment Providers, KYC
  services, AI APIs if used).
- Configure alerts to notify relevant teams (e.g., DevOps, Finance) when actual or forecasted
  spending exceeds thresholds (e.g., 80%, 100% of budget).
- Regularly review budget performance and adjust budgets or optimization strategies as needed.

## Cost Review Process

- **Frequency:** Conduct monthly cost review meetings.
- **Attendees:** DevOps, Engineering Leads, potentially Finance/Product, Compliance (to ensure
  optimizations meet NBE rules).
- **Agenda:**
  - Review overall spending trends vs. budget (AWS Cost Explorer, Provider Reports).
  - Analyze spending by service, environment, tags (incl. `Compliance=nbe`).
  - Identify significant cost drivers (e.g., Telebirr fees, specific AWS service, data egress).
  - Discuss and prioritize new optimization opportunities.
  - Track progress on previously identified optimization tasks.
