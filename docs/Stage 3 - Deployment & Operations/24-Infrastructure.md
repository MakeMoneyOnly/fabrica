## 4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

### Terraform Configuration

Our infrastructure is managed with Terraform (_chosen for its mature ecosystem, declarative syntax,
multi-cloud capabilities (future-proofing), and strong community support_) to ensure consistency,
repeatability, and documentation of all cloud resources, **including configurations specific to NBE
compliance and the Ethiopian operating environment.**

- **Repository Structure:**

  ```
  terraform/
  ├── environments/
  │   ├── dev/
  │   ├── staging/
  │   └── production/
  ├── modules/
  │   ├── networking/

  │   └── compliance/
  └── global/
      ├── iam/
      ├── dns/
      └── security-controls/
  ```

- **State Management:**
  - Terraform state stored in S3 bucket with versioning
  - State locking via DynamoDB
  - Separate state files per environment
  - State file encryption
  - Access logging for state operations

- **Module Example (VPC with NBE Compliance Considerations):**

  ```hcl
  module "vpc" {
    source = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
    version = "5.0.0" // Use a recent version

    name = "meqenet-${var.environment}-vpc"
    cidr = "10.0.0.0/16" // Example CIDR

    azs             = slice(data.aws_availability_zones.available.names, 0, 3) // Use available AZs in the chosen region
    private_subnets = [for k, v in data.aws_availability_zones.available.names : cidrsubnet("10.0.0.0/16", 8, k + 10)] // Example dynamic private subnets
    public_subnets  = [for k, v in data.aws_availability_zones.available.names : cidrsubnet("10.0.0.0/16", 8, k + 0)] // Example dynamic public subnets
    database_subnets = [for k, v in data.aws_availability_zones.available.names : cidrsubnet("10.0.0.0/16", 8, k + 20)] // Example dynamic database subnets

    enable_nat_gateway = true
    single_nat_gateway = false // Multiple NAT gateways for HA
    # enable_vpn_gateway = false // Only if VPN needed

    # Flow logs for security monitoring (NBE Requirement)
    enable_flow_log                      = true
    create_flow_log_cloudwatch_log_group = true
    flow_log_max_aggregation_interval    = 60

    # VPC Endpoints for secure AWS service access (Good practice, may support NBE goals)
    enable_s3_endpoint       = true
    enable_dynamodb_endpoint = true // If using DynamoDB
    enable_ecr_api_endpoint  = true
    # Add other endpoints as needed (e.g., KMS, Secrets Manager)

    tags = {
      Environment = var.environment
      Project     = "meqenet-ethiopia"
      Compliance  = "nbe"
      ManagedBy   = "terraform"
    }
  }
  ```

- **Compliance Monitoring:**
  - AWS Config Rules mapped to NBE security and operational requirements.
  - AWS Security Hub for security posture management (check for NBE compliance packs if available).
  - GuardDuty for threat detection
  - CloudTrail for comprehensive audit logging _(Key metrics: API call volumes, access patterns)_

## 5. Payment Processing Infrastructure (Ethiopian Providers)

### Payment Gateway Integration

- **Secure Payment Processing:**
  - Dedicated infrastructure components (e.g., specific K8s pods/services) for handling interactions
    with Ethiopian payment providers (Telebirr, HelloCash, etc.).
  - End-to-end encryption for payment-related data.
  - Secure handling of API keys/credentials for each provider via AWS Secrets Manager.
  - No storage of sensitive provider credentials or raw payment details unless absolutely necessary
    and compliant with NBE rules.

- **Compliance Focus (NBE):**
  - Ensure integration methods align with NBE security standards for third-party connections.
  - Network segmentation to isolate payment integration components.
  - Strict access controls for services interacting with payment providers.

- **Transaction Processing Redundancy:**
  - Potential for multi-provider strategy (e.g., Telebirr as primary, HelloCash as fallback) if
    business requirements dictate.
  - Fallback mechanisms defined in application logic.
  - Circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures during provider outages.

### Financial Data Storage (NBE Alignment)

- **Data Classification:**
  - Cardholder Data (CHD): Highest security level, tokenized where possible
  - Personally Identifiable Information (PII): High security level, encrypted at rest and in transit
  - Financial Transaction Data: High security level, encrypted and immutable
  - Application Data: Standard security level

- **Data Lifecycle Management:**
  - Retention policies based on NBE regulations (e.g., 7+ years for financial records).
  - Secure data deletion processes compliant with Ethiopian laws.

## 6. Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity (Ethiopian Context)

- **Recovery Time Objectives (RTO):**
  - Payment Processing (via Ethiopian Providers): < 30 minutes (factor in provider dependencies)

- **Recovery Point Objectives (RPO):**
  - Financial Transactions (ETB): < 1 minute (near-zero data loss)

- **Backup Strategy:**
  - Database: Point-in-time recovery with transaction logs (Backups stored according to NBE rules,
    potentially within specific regions).

- **Multi-Region Considerations (If Applicable):**
  - Primary Region: Chosen based on NBE rules/latency. _(Note: Final region choice, e.g.,
    `af-south-1` or other suitable region, pending confirmation of specific NBE rules and latency
    tests.)_
  - DR Region: Chosen based on NBE rules, latency, and AWS service availability.
  - Data replication strategy must comply with NBE data localization rules.

## 7. Compliance & Security Automation (NBE Focus)

- **Continuous Compliance Checks:**
  - AWS Config Rules mapped to NBE security and operational requirements.

## 8. Mobile App Infrastructure (Ethiopian Considerations)

- **Push Notification Service:**
  - AWS SNS for cross-platform push notifications (ensure reliability to Ethiopian networks).

## 9. Cost Optimization Strategy (Ethiopian Market)

- **Reserved Instances:**
  - RDS and ElastiCache instances on 1-year reservations
  - EC2/EKS compute with combination of Reserved Instances and Spot Instances for non-critical
    workloads

- **Autoscaling Policies:**
  - Time-based scaling for predictable patterns
  - Load-based dynamic scaling
  - Scale-to-zero for development environments

- **Resource Rightsizing:**
  - Regular review of resource utilization based on actual Ethiopian user load.

- **Storage Optimization:**
  - S3 Lifecycle Policies for tiered storage (consider NBE retention rules).
  - RDS storage autoscaling with thresholds
  - Data retention policies aligned with NBE requirements.
