# Stan Store Windsurf - Creator AI Integration & Performance Intelligence

## Overview

This document details the integration of AI services into the Stan Store Windsurf creator platform, providing sophisticated machine learning capabilities to optimize creator store performance, product recommendations, and Ethiopian market intelligence. AI services leverage advanced analytics while maintaining strict creator data sovereignty and Ethiopian data protection compliance. For comprehensive details on our creator monetization model and business approach, see [Business Model](../Stage%201%20-%20Foundation/03-Business_Model.md).

**Microservice Architecture & AI:** AI capabilities are implemented as dedicated microservices
(e.g., a `fraud-detection-service`) or as part of a larger, domain-focused service. This approach
ensures that AI logic is scalable, maintainable, and securely isolated within our broader
microservice ecosystem.

Secure handling of API keys and credentials must follow the secrets management guidelines in
`.cursorrules`.

### Cross-Service AI Communication

- **Shared AI Utilities:** Common AI client configurations and error handling in `shared/lib/ai/`
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Services communicate AI results and trigger actions via an event
  bus (e.g., Kafka). For example, a new transaction event from the `payments-service` can be
  consumed by the `fraud-service` for real-time analysis.
- **Direct gRPC Calls:** For synchronous requests, services can communicate directly via efficient,
  strongly-typed gRPC calls.
- **Centralized AI Monitoring:** AI service health, performance, and model drift are monitored
  through our central observability platform.
- **AI Model Registry:** A centralized registry manages AI model versioning and deployment across
  all services.

## Comprehensive Prompt Engineering for Ethiopian Financial Ecosystem

The credit risk assessment leverages AI to evaluate users across all four payment options, each with
distinct risk profiles:

- **Payment Option Specific Risk Factors:**

  **Pay in 4 (Interest-Free):**
  - Lower individual transaction risk due to smaller amounts
  - Frequency of usage indicates financial stress or preference
  - Completion rate patterns across multiple concurrent plans
  - Seasonal usage patterns (e.g., holiday shopping)

  **Pay in 30 (Interest-Free):**
  - Medium-term repayment capability assessment
  - Income stability indicators
  - Monthly cash flow analysis
  - Single large payment risk vs. installment risk

  **Pay Over Time (6-24 months with Interest):**
  - Long-term financial stability assessment
  - Income verification and consistency
  - Interest rate sensitivity analysis
  - Debt-to-income ratio considerations
  - Credit history building opportunity

  **Pay in Full Today:**
