# Stan Store Windsurf - Creator Platform API Documentation Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the API strategy and specifications for Stan Store Windsurf, focusing on creator digital product monetization, no-code store building capabilities, and Ethiopian payment processing. The API design supports the multi-tenant creator platform architecture, ensuring creator data sovereignty and seamless ETB transaction processing.

**Domain-Driven API Design:** APIs are organized by service domains (`auth`, `kyc`, `credit`,
`payments`, `marketplace`, etc.) with clear boundaries and standardized interfaces. Each
microservice exposes its own API endpoints, which are aggregated and managed by a central API
Gateway.

## 1. API Architecture Strategy

### API Gateway & Communication Protocols

- **API Gateway:** A central API Gateway serves as the single entry point for all external client
  requests (mobile, web). It handles routing, rate limiting, authentication, and request
  aggregation.
- **External vs. Internal APIs:**
  - **External (North-South):** The public-facing API exposed by the Gateway uses **REST** and
    **GraphQL** for maximum flexibility and ease of use by client applications.
  - **Internal (East-West):** Service-to-service communication relies on high-performance protocols.
    **gRPC** is used for synchronous request/response, and an **Event Bus (Kafka)** is used for
    asynchronous, event-driven communication.
- **Service Mesh:** A service mesh manages internal service communication, providing load balancing,
  circuit breakers, and observability.
- **API Versioning:** Semantic versioning (v1, v2) is used for the external API, with clear backward
  compatibility and deprecation policies.
- **Documentation:** Auto-generated OpenAPI 3.0 specifications for REST endpoints and `.proto` files
  for gRPC services serve as the primary documentation.

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Authentication Methods:**
  - JWT tokens for web/mobile applications
  - API keys for merchant integrations
  - OAuth 2.0 PKCE for third-party integrations
  - mTLS for high-security internal communications

- **Authorization Framework:**
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) for users and merchants
  - Feature-based permissions for premium users
  - Scope-based access for external integrations
  - Dynamic authorization based on user context and risk assessment
