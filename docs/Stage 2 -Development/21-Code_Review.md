# Stan Store Windsurf - Creator Platform Code Review Guidelines

## Overview

This document outlines comprehensive code review guidelines for Stan Store Windsurf creator platform, focusing on no-code store building capabilities, Ethiopian creator monetization, and digital product marketplace features. Code reviews ensure creator platform security, multi-tenant data sovereignty, and Ethiopian market compliance.

**Code Review in a Microservice Architecture:** Code reviews are organized by service domains (e.g.,
`payments-service`, `rewards-service`). Each service has dedicated owners and reviewers, but
cross-service changes require additional integration review. This ensures both service autonomy and
overall system integrity.

All code review processes must adhere to the security and quality standards outlined in
`.cursorrules`.
