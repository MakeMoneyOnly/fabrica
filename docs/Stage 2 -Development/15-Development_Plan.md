# Stan Store Windsurf - Creator Platform Development Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the phased development plan for Stan Store Windsurf, Ethiopia's premier no-code creator storefront platform. The plan focuses on delivering value incrementally to Ethiopian creators, starting with creator authentication and progressing through store builder development, Ethiopian payment integration, and advanced creator analytics. The development strategy prioritizes creator productivity, zero transaction fees, and native Ethiopian payment processing through WeBirr, TeleBirr, and CBE Birr integrations.

## Development Process & Standards

- **Agile Methodology:** Implement two-week sprints with planning, daily stand-ups, reviews, and
  retrospectives across all development teams.
- **Version Control:** Use Git with feature branching, pull requests, and mandatory code reviews
  with security validation for all ecosystem components.

  additional focus on security, financial transaction validation, rewards calculations, payment plan
  processing, and marketplace operations.
- **CI/CD:** Establish secure, independent Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment
  pipelines for each microservice to enable autonomous deployments.
- **Coding Standards:** All code must adhere to project style guides with strict emphasis on
  security best practices for financial applications, interest calculations, and data protection.
