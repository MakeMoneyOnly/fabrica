# Stan Store Windsurf - Technology Stack

## 1. Introduction & Core Principles

This document details the technologies, frameworks, and services selected for the Stan Store Windsurf creator platform. Our tech stack is optimized for a multi-tenant creator platform with Ethiopian market requirements, focusing on ease of use for non-technical creators while maintaining enterprise-grade scalability and security.

## Core Principles for Stan Store Windsurf

### Creator-First Technology Choices
- **Builder Performance**: Technologies enabling fast, intuitive no-code store creation
- **Multi-Tenant Efficiency**: Optimized for creator isolation with minimal overhead
- **Ethiopian User Experience**: Technologies supporting Amharic, mobile-first design, and local payment integration
- **Creator Growth Focus**: Analytics, automation, and monetization features prioritized
- **Zero Transaction Fees**: Platform designed to support transparent, fee-free creator economy

## 2. Technology Governance

Teams may propose alternative technologies. The process is:

1.  **Proposal**: The team documents the proposed technology, the rationale for deviating from the
    paved road, and an analysis of its pros and cons (including security, cost, and operational
    overhead).
2.  **Architecture Review**: The proposal is reviewed by the architecture governance body.
3.  **Decision**: If approved, the technology is added to a list of "approved alternatives," and the
    team is responsible for integrating it with our standard tooling.
