## 2. Creator Platform Architecture Approach

Stan Store Windsurf's architecture is built on **Microservice Architecture** optimized for multi-tenant creator platform requirements. The backend uses modular services while the frontend implements **component-based architecture** focused on creator productivity and Ethiopian user experience.

### 2.1 Why Microservices for Creator Platforms?

We have chosen a microservice architecture for its strategic advantages in scaling creator platforms:

- **Creator Isolation:** Each creator's store operates in complete isolation with dedicated service instances
- **Multi-Tenant Efficiency:** Services can efficiently handle thousands of creators while maintaining separation
- **Creator-Centric Scaling:** Scale individual services based on creator growth and feature usage
- **Payment Flexibility:** Separate Ethiopian payment integration services for different gateways (WeBirr, TeleBirr, CBE Birr)
- **Creator Analytics:** Dedicated analytics services per creator while maintaining platform-wide insights
- **Fault Isolation:** One creator's store issues don't affect others; platform remains stable
- **Technology Flexibility:** Advanced creators can use different payment integrations without affecting others

### 2.2 Modular Component Architecture

Our frontend architecture prioritizes creator productivity through:

- **Drag-and-Drop Builder Components:** Modular, reusable components for no-code store creation
- **Ethiopian UI Components:** Localized components supporting Amharic text and Ethiopian design preferences
- **Mobile-Responsive Design:** Components optimized for Ethiopian mobile browsing patterns
- **Creator Workflow Components:** Specialized components for subscription management, store analytics, and customer communication

## 3. Key Creator Platform Architectural Components

### 3.1 Creator Platform Microservices

Our backend is decomposed into specialized microservices optimized for multi-tenant creator platform operations:

- **API Gateway & Creator Router:** Handles creator authentication, tenant routing, and intelligent load balancing for creator stores
- **Creator Management Service:** Manages creator profiles, subscriptions, and multi-tenant account isolation
- **Store Builder Engine:** Powers no-code store creation with drag-and-drop functionality and theme management
- **Ethiopian Payment Integration:** Dedicated services for WeBirr, TeleBirr, CBE Birr payment processing and settlement
- **Digital Delivery Service:** Manages secure file downloads, access controls, and digital product delivery
- **Creator Analytics Engine:** Processes creator performance metrics and revenue analytics
- **Notification & Communication:** SMS/email notifications in Amharic/English for creators and customers

### 3.2 Creator Web Platform

- **Creator Dashboard:** Next.js-based interface for store management, analytics, and customer communication
- **No-Code Store Builder:** Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for creating professional Ethiopian creator stores
- **Mobile-Responsive Storefronts:** Automatic optimization for Ethiopian mobile browsing patterns
- **Creator Community Hub:** Networking and collaboration features for Ethiopian content creators

### 3.4 Data Services & Storage

- **Database-per-Service**: Each microservice has its own dedicated PostgreSQL database, ensuring
  loose coupling and data isolation.
- **Decentralized Data Management**: Service teams have full ownership of their data schema and are
  responsible for its evolution and maintenance.
- **API-Only Access**: Direct database access between services is strictly prohibited. All data
  exchange must occur through versioned, backward-compatible service APIs.

### 3.5 Service Discovery

Our architecture uses Kubernetes' built-in DNS-based service discovery. When a service is deployed,
Kubernetes automatically creates a stable DNS entry (e.g.,
`payments-service.default.svc.cluster.local`). Other services within the cluster can then reliably
discover and communicate with it using this address, without needing to hardcode IP addresses or
ports. This provides a robust and automated service registry directly within our orchestration
platform.

### 3.6 Cross-Cutting Architectural Patterns

#### 3.6.1 Idempotency

To prevent data corruption and inconsistent state from duplicate requests (e.g., due to network
retries), all state-modifying endpoints (especially those in the `payments-service`) **MUST** be
idempotent. This is achieved by requiring clients to generate and send a unique `Idempotency-Key` in
the header of `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` requests. The server will store the result of the first
successful request for a given key and return this cached response for any subsequent requests with
the same key.

#### 3.6.2 Caching

To ensure high performance and reduce load on backend services, a distributed caching layer (e.g.,
Redis) **MUST** be implemented. This cache will be used for:

- **Read-heavy flows:** Caching product catalog data, merchant details, and other frequently
  accessed, non-critical data in the `merchant-service` and `marketplace-service`.
- **Session Management:** Storing session data to reduce database load.
- **Rate Limiting:** Caching request counts for rate-limiting implementations in the API Gateway.

## 4. Cross-Cutting Concerns

These concerns are managed centrally but apply to all services within the ecosystem:

- **Observability:** We use a centralized stack (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger) for logging,
  monitoring, and tracing to ensure deep visibility into system health.
- **Security:** Comprehensive security is implemented at every layer. Refer to the
  [Security](./07-Security.md) document for details.
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** A fully automated CI/CD pipeline for each service allows for independent and
  rapid build, test, and deployment cycles.

## 5. Event-Driven Architecture Standards

While many interactions are synchronous via gRPC, asynchronous, event-based communication is
critical for decoupling services and ensuring resilience. All event-driven patterns **MUST** adhere
to the following standards.

### 5.1. Event Schema and Documentation

To ensure clarity and prevent integration issues, all asynchronous events **MUST** be formally
documented using the **AsyncAPI** specification. Each service that produces events must maintain an
`asyncapi.yaml` file, defining the channels it publishes to and the schema of its event payloads.
This specification serves as the discoverable, version-controlled contract for all events.

### 5.2. Reliable Event Publishing (Transactional Outbox)

To guarantee that critical business events are published reliably (at-least-once delivery) and to
avoid dual-writes, services that publish events (e.g., `payments-service`) **MUST** implement the
**Transactional Outbox Pattern**. This pattern involves atomically committing the database state
change and the event to be published in the same local transaction. A separate outbox processor
service will then read from the outbox table and reliably publish the events to the message broker
(e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).

### 5.3. Disaster Recovery (DR)

Our disaster recovery strategy is based on a multi-region, active-passive model. Production
infrastructure is replicated to a secondary AWS region. In the event of a primary region failure,
traffic will be failed over after a manual approval gate. RPO (Recovery Point Objective) is targeted
at < 1 hour, and RTO (Recovery Time Objective) is targeted at < 4 hours. This is documented in
detail in the [Security](./07-Security.md) document.
