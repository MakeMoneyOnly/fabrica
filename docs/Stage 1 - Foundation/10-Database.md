# Stan Store Windsurf - Multi-Tenant Database Design

## Overview

This document outlines the database strategy and design principles for Stan Store Windsurf, Ethiopia's premier no-code creator storefront platform. The multi-tenant database architecture supports thousands of Ethiopian creators, each with isolated storefronts, while maintaining efficient resource sharing and creator data sovereignty.

**Creator-Centric Multi-Tenant Design:** The database strategy prioritizes creator isolation while enabling platform-wide efficiency. Each creator's store operates independently with complete data isolation, while the platform provides shared services for optimal resource utilization and cost management.

## 1. Creator Platform Database Architecture Strategy

### 1.1 Technology Stack

- **Primary Database:** PostgreSQL 15+ for multi-tenant ACID compliance and creator data isolation
- **Caching Layer:** Redis 7+ for creator session management, Ethiopian payment caching, and performance optimization
- **Search Engine:** Elasticsearch 8+ for creator product discovery, Ethiopian creator search, and analytics
- **Time-Series Database:** InfluxDB for creator metrics, store performance, and creator growth analytics
- **Data Warehouse:** Custom ETL pipelines for creator performance analytics and business intelligence
- **File Storage:** Cloud-based storage with ETB-optimized pricing for creator digital assets

### 1.2 Multi-Tenant Creator Data Distribution Strategy

Our database strategy is fundamentally designed for multi-tenant creator platform requirements, enabling thousands of Ethiopian creators to operate independently while maintaining platform efficiency.

- **Creator Schema Isolation:** Each creator's data is completely isolated in dedicated PostgreSQL schemas with strict row-level security (RLS) policies ensuring zero data leakage between creators
- **Platform Shared Services:** Common platform functionality (auth, payments, notifications) use shared database instances with multi-tenant tables and tenant identification columns
- **Elastic Creator Storage:** Creator onboarding dynamically provisions new database schemas with automated tenant setup, scaling, and backup configuration
- **Creator Data Sovereignty:** Creators maintain complete ownership of their customer data with export capabilities while platform ensures compliance with Ethiopian data protection laws
- **Cross-Creator Analytics:** Platform-wide analytics aggregate creator performance data anonymously while maintaining creator privacy and data isolation
- **Backup Per Creator:** Automated backups for each creator's data with point-in-time recovery capabilities specific to each creator's requirements

### 1.3 Data Architecture Principles

- **Single Source of Truth:** Each piece of data has one and only one owning microservice.
- **Domain-Driven Design:** Data models are designed around the business capabilities of each
  microservice.
- **API-Only Data Access:** All data access between services must occur through well-defined,
  versioned APIs. This prevents direct database coupling and creates a stable integration contract.
- **Event Sourcing:** For critical financial operations, we will store the full sequence of
  state-changing events as an immutable log, providing a complete and verifiable audit trail.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** For services with complex read requirements,
  we will separate the models used for writing data (commands) from those used for reading data
  (queries) to optimize performance and scalability.

## 2. Creator Data Governance & Compliance
