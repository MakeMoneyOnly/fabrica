# Stan Store Windsurf Security Framework

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security framework for the Stan Store Windsurf creator platform. It is built on a **Creator-Centric Zero Trust** model, ensuring robust protection for Ethiopian creators, their customers, and digital products while enabling seamless store creation and monetization.

The security framework addresses the unique challenges of a multi-tenant creator platform, including:
- Creator store isolation and data protection
- Digital product security and delivery
- Ethiopian payment gateway integration
- Multi-tenant analytics and creator privacy
- Mobile-first creator management security
- Cultural adaptation for Ethiopian creators

## 1. Creator Platform Security Architecture

### 1.1 Multi-Tenant Creator Security Zones

We classify creator platform components into security zones based on data sensitivity and creator isolation requirements.

- **Creator Data Zone (Level 1 - Highest Security):**
  - **Components:** Creator profiles, payment credentials, customer data per store
  - **Requirements:** End-to-end encryption, comprehensive audit logging, creator isolation, mandatory mTLS, separate secure databases, and continuous monitoring

- **Platform Core Zone (Level 2):**
  - **Components:** Store builder engine, payment processing, analytics aggregation
  - **Requirements:** Input validation, secure template rendering, WeBirr/TeleBirr integration security

- **Public Creator Zone (Level 3):**
  - **Components:** Published creator stores, public product listings, marketing content
  - **Requirements:** Rate limiting, DDoS protection, content security policies

### 1.2 Creator Isolation Principles

- **Tenant Data Separation:** Each creator's store operates in complete isolation with encrypted database schemas
- **Custom Domain Security:** Custom creator domains (creator.com) integrate with platform security controls
- **Payment Gateway Isolation:** Creator payment credentials encrypted and isolated per creator
- **Analytics Privacy:** Creator analytics aggregated anonymously without compromising individual privacy

### 1.3 Digital Product Security

- **Secure File Storage:** Encrypted storage of creator digital products and downloads
- **Access Control:** Creator-controlled download links with expiration and authentication
- **DRM-Free Delivery:** Secure delivery without restrictive DRM for creator flexibility
- **Backup Encryption:** Regular encrypted backups of all creator content and data

## 1. Microservice Security Framework

Our security strategy is built directly into our microservice architecture. By decomposing the
system into small, independent services, we create smaller attack surfaces and enforce strong
security boundaries at the service level.

### 1.1 Security Zones by Service Criticality

We classify our microservices into security zones based on the sensitivity of the data they handle.

- **High-Security Zone (Level 1):**
  - **Services:** `Auth Service`, `Payments Service`, `KYC Service`, `Credit Service`
  - **Requirements:** End-to-end encryption, comprehensive audit logging, real-time fraud detection,
    mandatory mTLS, separate secure subnets, and the highest level of monitoring.
- **Medium-Security Zone (Level 2):**
  - **Services:** `Merchant Service`, `Marketplace Service`, `Rewards Engine`
  - **Requirements:** Input validation, secure transaction handling, and strong authentication.
    Communication with Level 1 services is strictly controlled.
- **Controlled-Security Zone (Level 3):**
  - **Services:** `Analytics Service`, `Notification Hub`, `Search Service`
  - **Requirements:** Data must be anonymized where possible. Strict data access permissions and
    user consent management are enforced.

### 1.2 Service-to-Service Communication Security (East-West Traffic)

Securing communication between our internal microservices is paramount.

- **Mutual TLS (mTLS) is Mandatory:** All communication between services MUST be authenticated and
  encrypted using mTLS. This ensures that only trusted, verified services can communicate with each
  other. Unencrypted internal traffic is strictly prohibited.
- **Short-Lived Credentials:** Services must use short-lived, automatically rotated credentials
  (e.g., via SPIFFE/SPIRE or cloud IAM roles) to authenticate with each other. Long-lived static
  credentials or API keys for internal communication are forbidden.
- **Network Policies:** We will implement strict network policies (e.g., Kubernetes Network
  Policies, Security Groups) to explicitly define which services are allowed to communicate with
  each other on which ports. Default-deny all traffic.

### 1.3 Secrets Management

Managing secrets (API keys, database passwords, certificates) in a distributed system is a critical
security function.

- **Centralized Secrets Vault:** All secrets MUST be stored in a centralized, encrypted secrets
  management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
- **No Secrets in Code or Environment Variables:** Secrets MUST NOT be stored in source code,
  configuration files, or environment variables. Services must fetch secrets at runtime from the
  central vault using a secure identity mechanism (e.g., IAM roles).
- **Dynamic Secrets:** Where possible, services should use dynamic, on-demand secrets that are
  generated with a short time-to-live (TTL) for a specific task and automatically revoked afterward.

### 1.4 Container & Image Security

Since our microservices are deployed as containers, securing the container lifecycle is essential.

- **Vulnerability Scanning:** All container base images and application images MUST be scanned for
  known vulnerabilities (CVEs) as part of the CI/CD pipeline. Images with critical or high-severity
  vulnerabilities that have a fix available MUST be blocked from deployment.
- **Minimal Base Images:** Use minimal, hardened "distroless" base images to reduce the attack
  surface.
- **Immutable Containers:** Containers should be immutable. No changes (e.g., patching, installing
  software) should be made to a running container. To update, a new image is built and redeployed.
- **Run as Non-Root:** Containers MUST be configured to run as a non-root user.

## 2. Security Architecture & Design Principles
