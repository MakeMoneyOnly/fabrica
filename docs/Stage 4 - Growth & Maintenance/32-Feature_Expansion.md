  (e.g., partner readiness, other service teams) |

_Scores typically range from 1 (Low) to 5 (High). The product team reviews and adjusts scores based
on detailed proposals._

### User Research Requirements (Ethiopia)

Before committing significant resources to a major feature:

1.  Conduct user interviews/surveys with target Ethiopian user segments across all ecosystem
    features (considering language - Amharic/English, location, digital literacy, loyalty tiers,
    premium status).
2.  Create and validate wireframes/prototypes reflecting local context, ecosystem integration, and
    user expectations.
3.  Document specific pain points the feature addresses for Ethiopian users across their ecosystem
    journey.
4.  Identify potential usability challenges related to local infrastructure or common devices.
5.  Define success metrics from the perspective of Ethiopian users across the comprehensive
    ecosystem.

## 2. Technical Implementation Guidelines

### Microservice Principles for New Features

1.  **Bounded Context**: A new feature must align with the Bounded Context of a single service. If
    it spans multiple contexts, it should be implemented through collaboration between services, not
    by blurring the lines.
2.  **Single Responsibility**: Do not add functionality to a service that falls outside its core
    responsibility. This is a primary indicator that a new service may be needed.
3.  **Explicit APIs**: All communication between services must occur over the established gRPC APIs
    or the event bus. Direct database access between services is strictly forbidden.
4.  **Decentralized Data**: The service responsible for a feature owns that feature's data.

### Code Organization (Microservice Monorepo)

New backend features are implemented either within an existing service or by creating a new service
in the `/services` directory.
```

/ ├── services/ # Parent directory for all backend microservices │ ├── auth-service/ #
Authentication & security service │ ├── payments-service/ # Core payment processing service │ ├──
marketplace-service/ # Merchant marketplace & e-commerce service │ └── [new-service]/ # A new
microservice │ ├── src/ # Source code for the new service │ ├── Dockerfile # Docker definition for
the service │ ├── package.json # The service's own dependencies │ └── ... ├── libs/ # Shared
libraries used by multiple services │ ├── event-bus/ │ └── database-client/ ├── apps/ # Frontend
applications │ ├── mobile/ │ └── web/ └── package.json # Root package.json for monorepo tooling (Nx)

```

### State Management

Use the established state management library (**Redux Toolkit**) consistently. Organize state by feature domains while maintaining proper isolation.

*   **Service-Level Security**: Each service is responsible for authenticating and authorizing requests at its own boundary, even if the request came from another internal service (Zero Trust).
*   **Data Protection (Ethiopian Law):** Adhere to Ethiopia's data protection laws regarding collection, processing, and storage of personal data.
*   **NBE Security Directives:** Comply with relevant NBE directives for cybersecurity.
*   **Threat Modeling:** Conduct threat modeling for the new feature, considering its interactions with other services.
*   **Input Validation:** Rigorously validate all inputs at the service boundary.

### Financial Logic Guidelines (Comprehensive Ecosystem)

1.  **Isolate Financial Logic:** Implement calculations in dedicated, well-tested services/modules within appropriate feature domains.
2.  **Use Appropriate Data Types:** Use decimal types (e.g., Python's `Decimal`, JavaScript's `decimal.js`) for all ETB currency calculations across all features.
3.  **Cross-Feature Financial Consistency:** Ensure financial calculations are consistent across marketplace, rewards, premium, and core BNPL features.
4.  **Comprehensive Testing:** Rigorously test calculations for all payment options, marketplace transactions, rewards calculations, and premium billing.
5.  **NBE Compliance:** Ensure all financial logic adheres to NBE regulations regarding interest disclosure, fees, marketplace transactions, and reporting.
6.  **Transparent Financing:** Implement logic for clear disclosure of financing terms across all four payment options.
7.  **Audit Logging:** Implement detailed, immutable audit logs for every financial transaction across all ecosystem features.
8.  **Currency Handling:** Explicitly handle ETB currency codes and formatting according to local standards across all features.

## 3. Security Requirements for New Features

Refer to the main [Security Documentation](../Stage%201%20-%20Foundation/07-Security.md), but specifically for new features in the comprehensive ecosystem:

*   **Feature-Level Security Boundaries:** Maintain security isolation between feature domains as defined in FSA.
*   **Data Protection (Ethiopian Law):** Adhere to Ethiopia's data protection laws regarding collection, processing, and storage of personal data across all ecosystem features.
*   **NBE Security Directives:** Comply with relevant NBE directives for cybersecurity in financial institutions across all features.
*   **Comprehensive Threat Modeling:** Conduct threat modeling considering interactions across marketplace, rewards, premium, and core financial features.
*   **Input Validation:** Rigorously validate all inputs across all ecosystem touchpoints.
*   **Access Control:** Implement fine-grained, role-based access control considering premium tiers and feature access levels.
*   **Secure Integration:** Ensure secure handling of credentials and data exchange with third parties and between ecosystem features.
*   **Security Testing:** Include security test cases covering cross-feature interactions and ecosystem-wide security.

## 4. Integration Requirements

### API Expansion Guidelines

1.  **API Gateway**: For public-facing endpoints, update the API Gateway configuration to route requests to the appropriate service.
2.  **gRPC Contracts**: For internal communication, update the relevant `.proto` files to define new services, RPCs, or messages. These contracts are versioned and shared in a central repository.
3.  **Versioning**: Use clear API versioning (e.g., `/v1/` in the gateway, `v1` package in protobufs) to manage changes without breaking downstream consumers.
4.  **Documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)**: Update public API documentation thoroughly.

### Cross-Service Integration Guidelines

1.  **Public API Communication**: Use only well-defined public APIs for cross-feature communication.
2.  **Event-Driven Architecture**: Implement event-driven patterns for loose coupling between features.
3.  **Shared Data Consistency**: Ensure data consistency across features while maintaining boundaries.
4.  **Error Propagation**: Handle errors appropriately across feature boundaries.
*   **Cross-Service Integration Testing**: Test interactions between services via their public APIs and event contracts.
*   **Contract Testing**: Implement contract tests (e.g., using Pact) to ensure that service integrations do not break when a provider service changes its API.
*   **Feature Isolation:** Ensure features can be tested independently while maintaining ecosystem integrity.
*   **Compliance Testing:** Verify adherence to NBE rules across all ecosystem features.

### Third-Party Integrations (Ethiopia Focus)

1.  **Vendor Due Diligence:** Assess Ethiopian partners for security, reliability, and compliance across all ecosystem touchpoints.
2.  **Resilient Implementation:** Implement circuit breakers, retries, and clear error handling for all integrations.
3.  **Monitoring:** Set up comprehensive monitoring for all third-party integrations across ecosystem features.
4.  **Contractual Agreements:** Ensure clear SLAs considering ecosystem-wide dependencies.

## 5. User Experience Guidelines (Ethiopia Focus)

## 7. Documentation Requirements

*   **User Guides:** Update customer and merchant documentation for all affected ecosystem features.
*   **API Documentation:** Update OpenAPI/Swagger docs for any new or changed endpoints across features.
*   **Service-Level READMEs**: Each service must have a `README.md` that explains its purpose, how to run it locally, and its key dependencies.
