# Scalability Planning (Stan Store Windsurf Creator Platform)

## Overview

This document outlines the scalability strategy for the **Stan Store Windsurf creator platform**. It ensures the system can handle anticipated growth in Ethiopian creators, storefronts, digital products, and feature complexity while maintaining performance, reliability, and security within our **Creator Microservice Architecture**.

## 1. Scalability Principles (Ethiopian Creator Context & Microservice Architecture)

Our approach to scalability adapts core principles to the Ethiopian market:

1.  **Design for Growth:** Architect services assuming significant growth. Plan for 10x-20x current
    peak capacity as a target.
2.  **Independent Service Scaling:** Scale each microservice (e.g., `payments-service`,
    `marketplace-service`) independently based on its specific usage patterns.
3.  **Measure & Predict Locally:** Establish baseline performance metrics specific to Ethiopian user
    behavior and network conditions.
4.  **Scale Horizontally**: Prefer adding more instances of a service (horizontal scaling) over
    increasing the size of a single instance (vertical scaling).
5.  **Decouple via APIs & Events**: Leverage our microservice architecture to ensure services are
    loosely coupled and communicate via well-defined APIs (gRPC) or an event bus (Kafka).
6.  **Resilience to Local Infrastructure:** Design services to be resilient to fluctuations in local
    internet connectivity or partner service availability.

## 2. Load Projections and Capacity Planning (Ethiopia Ecosystem)

### Growth Metrics Tracking

Continuously monitor these metrics:

- **User Metrics (Ecosystem-Wide):**
  - Monthly Active Users (MAU) - Customers & Merchants
  - Daily Active Users (DAU) - Peak usage times
  - Peak Concurrent Users
  - Feature Adoption Rates

- **Transaction Metrics (All Payment Options):**
  - Transactions Per Second (TPS) by payment option
  - Marketplace Transaction Volume
  - Rewards Redemption Rate

- **Service-Specific Metrics:**
  - **Marketplace-Service:** Product views, searches, cart additions
  - **Rewards-Service:** Cashback calculations, tier upgrades
  - **Auth-Service:** Logins, token generations
  - ...and so on for each service.

- **System Metrics (Per-Service Level):**
  - API Requests/Second per service
  - Database Queries/Second per service
  - Inter-service communication volume (gRPC calls, events)
  - Cache Hit Rates per service

### Capacity Planning Model (Ecosystem-Adjusted)

Use a forward-looking model incorporating Ethiopia-specific factors and ecosystem complexity:

```
Future Capacity = Current Peak Capacity * (1 + Projected Monthly Growth Rate)^Months * Seasonal Factor * Feature Interaction Factor * Safety Factor
```

- **Current Peak Capacity:** Measured capacity during recent peak periods across all features
- **Projected Monthly Growth Rate:** Based on business forecasts and ecosystem adoption
- **Months:** Planning horizon (e.g., 6, 12 months)
- **Seasonal Factor:** Multiplier for Ethiopian peak seasons/events (e.g., 2.0x for holiday season)
- **Feature Interaction Factor:** Multiplier for cross-feature usage complexity (e.g., 1.3x)
- **Safety Factor:** Buffer for unexpected surges (typically 2.0 - 3.0).

### Scaling Triggers (Per-Service)

Define automatic scaling triggers based on service-specific performance thresholds:

| Service                 | Metric                   | Threshold          | Action                 |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| **Auth Service**        | CPU Utilization          | > 70% for 5 min    | Add 2 instances        |
|                         | Authentication Latency   | > 500ms for 3 min  | Add 2 instances        |
| **Payments Service**    | Payment Processing Queue | > 500 pending      | Add 3 instances        |
|                         | Credit Decision Latency  | > 1000ms for 5 min | Add 2 instances        |
| **Marketplace Service** | Product Search Latency   | > 1000ms for 3 min | Add 3 instances        |
| **Database (Primary)**  | CPU Utilization          | > 80% for 10 min   | Investigate / V. Scale |
| **Event Bus Consumers** | Message Queue Length     | > 5000 messages    | Add Queue Workers      |

## 3. Application Scalability Strategies (Microservice Architecture)

### Service Independence

Each microservice is built and configured to scale independently.

### Cross-Service Communication Optimization

Implement an event-driven architecture for non-blocking communication between services:

```typescript
// A service publishing an event
@Injectable()
export class PaymentsService {
  constructor(private readonly eventBus: EcosystemEventBus) {}

  async completeTransaction(transaction: Transaction) {
    // ... process payment ...

    // Notify other services asynchronously that a transaction was completed
    const event = new TransactionCompletedEvent(transaction);
    await this.eventBus.publish('transaction.completed', event);
  }
}

// Another service consuming the event
@Controller()
export class RewardsService {
  @EventPattern('transaction.completed')
  async handleTransactionCompleted(event: TransactionCompletedEvent) {
    // Calculate rewards based on the transaction
    await this.rewardsEngine.calculate(event.transaction);
  }
}
```

### Stateless Services

Ensure all microservices are stateless to allow for simple horizontal scaling. Any required state is
stored externally in a database (PostgreSQL) or cache (Redis).

## 4. Database Scalability Strategies (Ecosystem-Wide)

### Database-per-Service Pattern

Each microservice owns and manages its own database, ensuring data isolation and independent
scaling.

```typescript
// Example of configuring connections to multiple service databases
@Module({
  imports: [
    TypeOrmModule.forRoot({
      name: 'marketplaceDB',
      type: 'postgres',
      // ... connection config for the marketplace service's database
      entities: [Product, Order, Merchant],
    }),
    TypeOrmModule.forRoot({
      name: 'rewardsDB',
      type: 'postgres',
      // ... connection config for the rewards service's database
      entities: [CashbackTransaction, LoyaltyTier],
    }),
  ],
})
export class DatabaseModule {}
```

### Read Replicas for Read-Heavy Services

Configure read replicas for services with high read-to-write ratios, like the `marketplace-service`
or `analytics-service`.

## 5. Infrastructure and Network Scalability (Ecosystem-Wide)

### Container Orchestration per Service

```yaml
# Kubernetes deployment for a single microservice
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: marketplace-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: marketplace-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: marketplace-service
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: marketplace
          image: meqenet/marketplace-service:latest
          resources:
            requests:
              memory: '256Mi'
              cpu: '250m'
            limits:
              memory: '512Mi'
              cpu: '500m'
---
# Kubernetes service to expose the deployment
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: marketplace-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: marketplace-service
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 3000
```

### Auto-scaling Configuration per Service

```yaml
# Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for the marketplace service
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: marketplace-hpa
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: marketplace-service
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 10
  metrics:
    - type: Resource
      resource:
        name: cpu
        target:
          type: Utilization
          averageUtilization: 70
```

### CDN Optimization

```yaml
# CDN configuration for different feature assets
cdn_configuration:
  marketplace:
    - path: '/marketplace/products/images/*'
      cache_ttl: 86400 # 24 hours
      compression: true
    - path: '/marketplace/catalogs/*'
      cache_ttl: 3600 # 1 hour

  rewards:
    - path: '/rewards/badges/*'
      cache_ttl: 604800 # 7 days
    - path: '/rewards/tier-info/*'
      cache_ttl: 3600 # 1 hour

  analytics:
    - path: '/analytics/charts/*'
      cache_ttl: 1800 # 30 minutes

  shared:
    - path: '/assets/common/*'
      cache_ttl: 604800 # 7 days
```

## 8. Scalability Roadmap (Ecosystem Evolution)
