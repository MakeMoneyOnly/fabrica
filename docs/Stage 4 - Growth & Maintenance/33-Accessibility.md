## 1. Accessibility Standards

The **Meqenet.et** platform adheres to the following accessibility standards:

- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:** We strive to follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
  2.1 at the AA level as our primary standard.
- **Ethiopian Accessibility Regulations:** We adhere to any specific accessibility regulations
  mandated within Ethiopia and ensure compliance with NBE guidelines for financial service
  accessibility.
- **Accessibility in a Microservice Architecture**: Responsibility for accessibility is shared.
  Frontend applications (web, mobile) are responsible for rendering accessible UI/UX. Backend
  microservices are responsible for providing data and error messages in a way that supports
  accessible presentation.

## 2. Core Accessibility Principles (Based on WCAG)

We follow the four core principles of accessibility (POUR) across our entire platform:

### Perceivable

- **Text Alternatives:**
  - All non-text content (images, icons, logos, product images, QR codes, virtual card designs,
    charts) has appropriate text alternatives (`alt` text).
  - Complex visuals (marketplace analytics charts, financial dashboards, rewards tier
    visualizations, payment plan comparisons) have detailed descriptions or data tables.
  - Virtual card designs include accessible descriptions of visual elements.

- **Time-Based Media:**
  - Any video tutorials (payment setup, marketplace navigation, premium features) have accurate
    closed captions and transcripts.
  - Audio content (support recordings, promotional content) has transcripts.
  - No auto-playing media that includes sound across any ecosystem feature.

- **Adaptable Content:**
  - Content structure is logical and programmatically determinable (using semantic HTML) across all
    features.
  - The platform is responsive and usable on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) and
    orientations for all ecosystem features.
  - Information and structure are maintained when assistive technologies parse content from
    marketplace, rewards, analytics, and other features.
  - Feature-specific navigation maintains consistent accessibility patterns.

- **Distinguishable Content:**
  - Minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text and meaningful UI
    components/graphics across all features.
  - Information is not conveyed solely through color (e.g., use icons or text alongside color for
    status indicators, loyalty tiers, payment statuses).
  - Users can resize text up to 200% without loss of content or functionality across marketplace,
    rewards, analytics, and other features.
  - Clear visual distinction between interactive and non-interactive elements in all ecosystem
    components.
  - Virtual card displays maintain accessibility with high contrast and clear text.

### Operable

- **Keyboard Accessibility:**
  - All platform functionality (navigation, form submission, payment actions, marketplace browsing,
    rewards redemption, QR code generation, virtual card management) is accessible using only a
    keyboard.
  - No keyboard traps where focus cannot be moved away from an element across any feature.
  - Keyboard focus is clearly visible and follows a logical navigation order through all ecosystem
    interfaces.
  - Keyboard shortcuts, if implemented, are documented and do not conflict with browser/assistive
    technology shortcuts.
  - Feature-specific keyboard navigation patterns are consistent and intuitive.

- **Timing:**
  - Users have adequate time to read and use content; no critical actions rely on short time limits
    without a way to extend them (e.g., session timeouts, payment processing timeouts, QR code
    expiration).
  - Any moving, blinking, or scrolling content (e.g., marketplace carousels, promotional banners)
    can be paused, stopped, or hidden by the user.
  - Virtual card generation and QR code creation provide sufficient time for user interaction.

- **Navigation:**
  - Mechanisms are provided to bypass blocks of content (e.g., "skip to main content" links) across
    all features.
  - Page titles are descriptive and accurately reflect the page content for all ecosystem features.
  - Focus order is logical and preserves meaning across marketplace, rewards, analytics, and other
    features.
  - Link text clearly describes the destination or purpose across all ecosystem components.
  - Consistent navigation patterns are used across all features (customer portal, merchant portal,
    marketplace, rewards dashboard, analytics).

- **Input Methods:**
  - Support for various input methods beyond mouse (keyboard, touch, voice where applicable).
  - Touch target sizes are sufficient for users on mobile devices across all features.
  - QR code scanning provides alternative input methods for users who cannot use camera
    functionality.

### Understandable

- **Readable Content:**
  - Use clear and simple language, especially for financial terms, loan agreements, marketplace
    policies, rewards terms, premium subscription details, and instructions. Avoid jargon where
    possible, or provide definitions (link to Glossary).
  - Specify the primary language of the content (e.g., English, Amharic) using the `lang` attribute
    in HTML.
  - **Multi-language Support:** Ensure translations are accurate for all ecosystem features and that
    the interface correctly handles text direction (LTR/RTL) and character encoding. Screen reader
    support for all supported languages should be considered across all features.
  - Financial calculations and payment terms are presented in clear, understandable language.

- **Predictable Interaction:**
  - Navigation menus and UI components behave consistently across all ecosystem features.
  - Changes in context (e.g., opening a new window, navigating between features) are initiated by
    user action or explained in advance.
  - Components with the same functionality are identified consistently across all features.
  - Feature transitions maintain predictable navigation patterns.

- **Input Assistance:**
  - Clearly label all form fields (e.g., login, registration, payment forms, merchant details,
    product listings, rewards redemption).
  - Provide clear instructions for required formats (e.g., phone number format, date format, payment
    amounts, virtual card limits).
  - Input errors are identified clearly, described in text, and suggestions for correction are
    provided across all features.
  - For critical financial transactions, marketplace purchases, rewards redemption, or data
    submissions, provide mechanisms for users to review, confirm, and correct information before
    finalizing.
  - Payment plan selections include clear explanations of terms and conditions.

### Robust

- **Compatible:**
  - Use valid HTML and CSS according to specifications across all ecosystem features.
  - Ensure proper nesting of elements and unique IDs across all features.
  - Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies.
  - Custom UI components across all features have appropriate ARIA roles, states, and properties
    defined to ensure they are interpretable by assistive technologies.
  - Status messages (e.g., payment confirmations, rewards earned) are programmatically determinable
    (e.g., using ARIA live regions) so assistive technologies can announce them.
  - Feature-specific components maintain robust accessibility standards.

## 3. Implementation Guidelines

### Shared Responsibility in a Microservice Architecture

- **Frontend Applications (Web & Mobile)**:
  - Are the primary owners of UI/UX accessibility.
  - Implement semantic HTML/native components, manage focus, handle ARIA attributes, and ensure
    color contrast.
  - Are responsible for making the final rendered output compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA.
- **Backend Microservices**:
  - Provide data with accessibility in mind. For example, an image URL should be accompanied by its
    `alt` text.
  - Return structured, clear, and human-readable error messages that can be presented accessibly by
    the frontend.
  - Do not return data formatted in a way that prevents accessible presentation (e.g., embedding
    text in images).

### Frontend Development

- **Semantic HTML:**
  - Prioritize using native HTML elements for their built-in semantics and accessibility features
    (`<button>`, `<a>`, `<nav>`, `<input>`, etc.) across all features.
  - Structure content logically using headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<dl>`),
    and landmark roles (`<main>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`) for all ecosystem features.
  - Use appropriate semantic elements for financial data, product information, and rewards displays.

- **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications):**
  - Use ARIA roles and attributes judiciously to enhance accessibility for custom controls or
    dynamic content where standard HTML is insufficient across all features.
  - Ensure ARIA implementations are correct; incorrect ARIA can be worse than no ARIA.
  - Use `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` for controls lacking visible text labels (e.g., icon
    buttons, QR code scanners, virtual card controls).
  - Manage dynamic states with attributes like `aria-expanded`, `aria-selected`, `aria-invalid`
    across marketplace filters, rewards tiers, and payment options.
  - Announce dynamic updates using `aria-live` regions for payment processing, rewards earning, and
    marketplace updates.

- **Focus Management:**
  - Ensure a visible and logical focus order when navigating with a keyboard across all features.
  - Manage focus appropriately within modal dialogs (payment confirmations, product details, rewards
    redemption) and return focus to the trigger element when the modal is closed.
  - Customize focus indicators only if the default browser indicators are insufficient, ensuring
    they meet contrast requirements across all features.

- **Forms:**
  - Explicitly associate `<label>` elements with their corresponding form controls across all
    features.
  - Group related controls using `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` for payment options, marketplace
    filters, and rewards settings.
  - Indicate required fields clearly (e.g., with text like "(required)" alongside visual cues)
    across all forms.
  - Provide clear, accessible error messages linked programmatically to the invalid field for all
    ecosystem features.

- **Images and Media:**
  - Provide meaningful `alt` text for informative images including product images, rewards tier
    badges, and virtual card designs.
  - Use `alt=""` for decorative images.
  - Ensure QR codes have appropriate alternative text describing their purpose.
  - Ensure any embedded media has accessible controls and alternatives.

- **Color and Contrast:**
  - Verify color combinations meet WCAG AA contrast ratios across all features.
  - Ensure information conveyed by color (loyalty tiers, payment statuses, marketplace categories)
    is also available through text or other visual cues.
  - Consider users with color blindness in all visual designs.

- **Screen Reader Testing:** Test thoroughly with **VoiceOver (iOS)** and **TalkBack (Android)**
  across the entire user flow.

### Framework-Specific Guidelines (Next.js Web)

- **Server-Side Rendering:** Ensure accessibility attributes are properly rendered on the server.
- **Client-Side Routing:** Manage focus and announce route changes appropriately when navigating
  between pages.
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Ensure core functionality remains accessible even without JavaScript
  where possible.
